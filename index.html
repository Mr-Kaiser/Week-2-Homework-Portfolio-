                >Hello there! My name is James and I'm an aspiring web developer and IT specialist,
                and I've always been very passionate about computers and technology.
                I taught myself how to build computers when I was in high school and it has eveloped me entirely ever since. 
                After graduating high school I attended Bridgerland Technical college and recieved multiple certifications in the IT industry. 
                After recieving both the CompTIA A+ and Security+ I got my current position as a Service Desk Technician for the US Air Force.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently started the University of Utah's Coding bootcamp program and hope to build
                rsue a career leveraging all the knowlege I have learned in both my previous and
                current education as well as my current carreer in IT.
            </p>
