        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello there! My name is James and I'm an aspiring web developer and IT specialist, and I've always been very passionate about computers and technology. I taught myself how to build computers when I was in high school and it has eveloped me entirely ever since. After graduating high school I attended Bridgerland Technical college and recieved multiple certifications in the IT industry. After recieving both the CompTIA A+ and Security+ I got my current position as a Service Desk Technician for the US Air Force.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recently started the University of Utah's Coding bootcamp program and hope to build and persue a career leveraging all the knowlege I have learned in both my previous and current education as well as my current carreer in IT.
